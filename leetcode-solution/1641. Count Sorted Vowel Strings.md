## **[1641. Count Sorted Vowel Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-sorted-vowel-strings/)**

### Question
Given an integer n, return the number of strings of length n that consist only of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) and are lexicographically sorted.

A string s is lexicographically sorted if for all valid i, s[i] is the same as or comes before s[i+1] in the alphabet.

Constraints:
- `1 <= n <= 50`

### Solution
Similar to [1220. Count Vowels Permutation](https://github.com/doudou-h/doudou-h.github.io/blob/main/leetcode-solution/1220.%20Count%20Vowels%20Permutation.md)

- Time complexity: **O(n)**
- Space complexity: **O(n)**

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def countVowelStrings(self, n: int) -> int:
        vowels = 'aeiou'
        
        @lru_cache(maxsize=None)
        def f(c, n):
            """return the number of lexi sorted strings of length n starting from char c"""
            if n == 1: return 1
            res = 0
            for nc in vowels:
                if ord(nc) >= ord(c):
                    res += f(nc, n - 1)
            return res
        
        return sum(f(c, n) for c in vowels)
```
