## **[4. Largest palindrome product](https://projecteuler.net/problem=4)**

### Question
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

### Solution
```python
def p4():
    return max(n * m for n in range(100, 1000) for m in range(n, 1000) if str(n * m) == str(n * m)[::-1])
```

### Answer 
`906609`

### Bonus
[Hackerrank Project Euler #4](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges/euler004/problem) Given T numbers, for each number N, find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers which is less than N.
Constraints:
- `1 <= T <= 100`
- `101101 < N < 1000000`
