## **[29. Distinct powers](https://projecteuler.net/problem=29)**

### Question
How many distinct terms are in the sequence generated by ![eq](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?a^b) for 2 ≤ a ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ b ≤ 100?

### Solution
```python
def p29(N = 100):
    return len(set(a ** b for a in range(2, N + 1) for b in range(2, N + 1)))
```

### Answer 
`9183`

How many distinct terms are in the sequence generated by ![eq](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?a^b) for 2 ≤ a ≤ N and 2 ≤ b ≤ N?

Constraints:
- `2 <= N <= 10^5`

The above brute force solution only works when N is small. It takes around 10 seconds to get an answer when N = 1000, which is unbearable.
