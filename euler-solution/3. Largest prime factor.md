    while N > 1:
        if N % p == 0:
            N //= p
        else: p += 1
    return p

### Bonus
The above solution doesn't pass all test cases on [Hackerrank Project Euler #3](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges/euler003/problem) due to timeout. A minor change will improve the performance significantly

```python
def p3():
    N = 600851475143
    p = 2
    while N >= p * p: # minor change here
        if N % p == 0:
            N //= p
        else:
            p += 1
    return N
```
