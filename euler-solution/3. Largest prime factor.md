## **[3. Largest prime factor](https://projecteuler.net/problem=3)**

### Question
The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.
What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?

### Solution
```python
def p3(N = 600851475143):
    p = 2
    while N > 1:
        if N % p == 0:
            N //= p
        else: p += 1
    return p
```

### Answer 
`6857`


### Bonus
The above solution doesn't pass all test cases on [Hackerrank Project Euler #3](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges/euler003/problem) due to timeout. A minor change will improve the performance significantly. It is because if a number `N` is not divisible by any number from `2` to `sqrt(N)`, then `N` is a prime number.

e.g. If `N = 19946`, in the first solution, we increase `p` from `2` to `9973`. In the second solution, `p` is increased from `2` to `100` therefore much faster.   
(19946 = 2 * 9973, where 9973 is the largest prime number under 10000)

```python
def p3(N = 600851475143):
    p = 2
    while N >= p * p: # minor change here
        if N % p == 0:
            N //= p
        else: p += 1
    return N
```
